## Preparing the data:

1. feature engineering - initator/creator
2. feature - is verified contract
3. fix label identifier

## ML processing:

1. Move to cross validation
2. Scaling data
3. Trim decision tree
4. Add Random forest
5. Add validation set: https://towardsdatascience.com/why-do-we-need-a-validation-set-in-addition-to-training-and-test-sets-5cf4a65550e0#:~:text=Using%20validation%20and%20test%20sets,trying%20different%20combinations%20of%20hyperparameters
6. scaling Y axis in plots to logrithim
